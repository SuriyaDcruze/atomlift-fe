- Key topics: removed Customers and AMC shortcuts from home screen; noted missing prior chat log.
- Code changes: updated `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` menu items and handler.
- Decisions: keep other navigation paths intact; create `chat.txt` for logging going forward.
- Next steps: verify home UI manually; confirm if additional screens should be hidden elsewhere.

- Key topics: removed Add Customer and Create AMC access from home drawer and navigation.
- Code changes: updated `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`, `src/components/CustomDrawer.tsx`, and `types/index.ts`.
- Decisions: leave screens in codebase but unreachable from home UI; drawer no longer shows those options.
- Next steps: manual UI verification to ensure buttons are gone; decide later if screens/routes should be deleted entirely.

- Key topics: deleted AddCustomer and CreateAMCScreen components per request.
- Code changes: removed `src/screens/AddCustomerScreen.tsx` and `src/screens/CreateAMCScreen.tsx`.
- Decisions: no other references remained after earlier cleanup.
- Next steps: confirm app builds without those screens; remove related assets if no longer needed later.
2025-11-15 10:15 UTC
- Key topics: removed Customers and AMC list screens entirely.
- Code changes: deleted `src/screens/CustomersScreen.tsx`, `src/screens/AMCListScreen.tsx`, and cleaned `HomeScreen.tsx` state/handlers.
- Decisions: keep other modules unchanged; assets still present for potential reuse.
- Next steps: build/test app to ensure no runtime references remain; optionally delete unused assets later.

- Key topics: Added service details functionality to TodayServicesScreen, ThisMonthDueScreen, ThisMonthOverdueScreen, and LastMonthOverdueScreen. Users can now click on service items to view detailed information including customer name and map location.
- Code changes: 
  - Created `src/screens/ServiceDetailsScreen.tsx` - new component displaying service details with customer information, AMC details, and map integration
  - Updated `src/screens/TodayServicesScreen.tsx` - made service items clickable, added navigation to details screen
  - Updated `src/screens/ThisMonthDueScreen.tsx` - made service items clickable, added navigation to details screen
  - Updated `src/screens/ThisMonthOverdueScreen.tsx` - made service items clickable, added navigation to details screen
  - Updated `src/screens/LastMonthOverdueScreen.tsx` - made service items clickable, added navigation to details screen
- Decisions: ServiceDetailsScreen shows customer name, service information, AMC details, and location with "Open in Maps" button that opens Google Maps. Used conditional rendering to switch between list and details view. All service items are now TouchableOpacity with activeOpacity for better UX.
- Next steps: Test the implementation to ensure navigation works correctly and map integration functions properly on devices.
